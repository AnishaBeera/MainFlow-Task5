🚀 Intern Project Highlight – Classification Task: Predicting Student Pass/Fail

During my internship at Main Flow Services and Technologies Pvt. Ltd., I had the opportunity to work on a hands-on machine learning classification project. Here’s a summary of what I accomplished:

🎯 Project: Student Pass/Fail Prediction

 🔍 Objective: Build a model to predict whether a student will pass or fail based on study hours and class attendance.

🔧 My Approach & Workflow:
1. Dataset Selection & Preparation
-Selected/created a dataset with key features:
 • Study Hours (hours per week)
 • Attendance (% of classes attended)
 • Pass (binary label: 1 for pass, 0 for fail)
2. Data Exploration & Visualization
-Conducted data quality checks for missing values and outliers
-Created visualizations to observe trends among study hours, attendance, and passing outcomes
3. Model Training
-Built and trained a Logistic Regression model using study hours and -attendance to predict pass/fail
4. Model Evaluation
-Assessed model performance via:
 • Accuracy – percentage of correct predictions
 • Confusion Matrix – analysis of true positives, true negatives, false positives, and false negatives

✅ Outcomes & Learnings:
-Developed strong data preprocessing and visualization skills.
-Gained practical experience implementing logistic regression for binary classification.
-Interpreted performance metrics and confusion matrix to enhance model interpretability.
